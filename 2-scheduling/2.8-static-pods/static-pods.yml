# Static PODs are created in controlplane
# The Kubelet can manage a POD independently
# The definition POD files should be under /etc/kubernetes/manifests which kubelet monitors all the time
# Only works for POD, not deployments or replicasets
# To check where the static pods are, go to kubelet.service file and check ExceStart... --config=kubeconfig.yml
# and then, in the kubeconfig.yml add "staticPodPath: /etc/kubernetes/manifests"
# These files can be seen by kubectl as static PODS, but cant be deleted or updated but from their original files. If it's delete using kubectl it will be reacreated

#Lab
# - kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep controlplane
# To get all namespaces use A
# - kubectl get pods -A 
# To get the definition of static PODs
# - /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml -> /etc/kubernetes/manifests
# - ssh <node-ip>
